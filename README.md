## Differential-Expression-Analysis-Bulk RNA sequencing

1.Differential Expression(DE) Analysis of Genes in Lung fibrosis model of Bleomycin induced injury and fibrosis by Bulk RNAsequencing. These genes are Specific to lung epithelial cells from Untreated and Bleomycin treated mice. 
 
2.Deseq2 from Bioconductor was used for this analysis. 

3.Also included in the code 

    a.Pathview to generate specific pathways based on DE genes. 
    b.Generate Rank file for Downstream analysis using Gene Set Enrichment Analysis(GSEA).
    c.Visualizations of Enriched Pathways.
